## Data Sources

This server uses six Swisstopo API families -- all without authentication (OEREB requires a canton parameter):

| Source | Documentation |
|--------|--------------|
| REST API | [api3.geo.admin.ch](https://api3.geo.admin.ch/) |
| Geocoding | [api3.geo.admin.ch](https://api3.geo.admin.ch/) |
| Height Service | [api3.geo.admin.ch](https://api3.geo.admin.ch/) |
| STAC Catalog | [data.geo.admin.ch](https://data.geo.admin.ch/) |
| WMTS | [wmts.geo.admin.ch](https://wmts.geo.admin.ch/) |
| OEREB Cadastre | Cantonal endpoints |

When adding new data sources, follow the **No-Auth-First** principle: Phase 1 uses only open, authentication-free endpoints. Authenticated APIs are introduced in later phases with graceful degradation.
